NOTE: If you have your folder name with multiple words use double quotes for the name of the folder when you use rmdir or mkdir
NOTE: rmdir removes folders that are empty. It won't delete non-empty folders 


NOTE: When you create a file starts with period (.), that means it is a hidden file.
How to reveal hidden files?
MAC-GUI -> cmd + shift + .
MAC-CLI -> ls -a
WINDOWS-GUI -> Go to view and see hidden items is checked
